				<h2>Harvard Business School Launches First Online Offering</h2>
				<p>Harvard Business School Online (formerly known as HBX) paved the way for developing a platform with a pedagogical opinion. In HBSO's case, that opinion was on how to teach HBS' case method asynchronously and at scale. The LXP will continue to develp that idea of platform as pedagogy to empower educators to build the next-generation of deeply engaging learning experiences.</p>

				<h2>HUIT-VPAL Platform Review Committee</h2>
				<p>Subject matter experts from HUIT and VPAL, with input from others such as DCE, engaged in a landscape review of Harvard's online learning ecosystem. The goal was to gain a full picture of the different platform investments and plans across Harvard.</p>

				<h2>LXP Envisioning Discovery Period</h2>
				<p>The Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning (VPAL) engaged Extension Engine, the primary vendor responsbile for the development of the original Harvard Business School Online platform, to help translate Harvard's vision for a potential next-generation learning experience platform into the feature level components of content authoring and delivery platform. The goal of this phase was to concretize the high-level designs and features that embody the unique value that the LXP vision represents. This phase was critical in allowing the LXP team to articulate the LXP in sufficient detail to be able to bring the vision to other Harvard stakeholders in the coming months as the idea of the LXP was socialized among key Harvard leadership and stakeholders.</p>

				<h2>Initial School and Harvard Leadership Engagement</h2>
				<p>During this period, the LXP team, led by VPAL, met with key leadership and stakeholders from across Harvard to listen to their digital learning experience needs and to begin to socialize the vision for the LXP and collect reactions and questions. Key contacts at each of the Harvard Schools as well as within major Harvard admniistrive units were identified as the initial "champions" to coordinate involvement with the LXP project.</p>

				<h2>Outside Activities Policy Group</h2>
				<p>The Outside Activities Policy groups was convened with the goal of ultimately developing a policy statement that provides faculty with guidance in pursuing outside activities that put their expertise to good use, while also safeguarding them and Harvard from undue risk. As faculty's outside activities increasingly involve engaging in online content development and delivery, this group's work impacted the motivation behind having flexbile Harvard controlled platforms to facilitate many of the different ways faculty may be engaging in online learning experiences that fall under outside activities. </p>

				<h2>Learning Experience Group</h2>
				<p>With the explosion in interest around online and hybrid forms of education, for both degree and non-degree learners, the Harvard Learning Experiences Group was convened to provide vision on how best to create deeply compelling learning experiences, provide advice on new technology ecosystems under consideration, and enable recommendations on how best to capitalize on the opportunities around teaching and learning, particularly those created by the unique experiences brought about due to the pandemic. This group met four times and included the following members: Bharat Anand (VPAL/HBS), Ronald Chandler (formely HBS), Kimberly Edelman (HUIT), Ryan Frazier (HBS), Sue Goldie (HSPH), Jack Jennings (GSE), Dan Levy (HKS), Jason Mcnamara (HBP), Rebecca Nesson (FAS), Rob Oatman (GSE), Michael Parker (HMS), Adrienne Phelps-Coco (DCE), Leah Plunkett (HLS), Teddy Svoronos (HKS), Dustin Tingley (VPAL/FAS), and Alan Wolf (HUIT).</p>
