				<h2>Harvard Business School Launches First Online Offering</h2>
				<p>Harvard Business School Online (formerly known as HBX) paved the way for developing a platform with a pedagogical opinion. In HBSO's case, that opinion was on how to teach HBS' case method asynchronously and at scale. The LXP will continue to develp that idea of platform as pedagogy to empower educators to build the next-generation of deeply engaging learning experiences.</p>

				<h2>LXP Envisioning Discovery Period</h2>
				<p>The Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning (VPAL) engaged Extension Engine, the primary vendor responsbile for the development of the original Harvard Business School Online platform, to help translate Harvard's vision for a potential next-generation learning experience platform into the feature level components of content authoring and delivery platform. The goal of this phase was to concretize the high-level designs and features that embody the unique value that the LXP vision represents. This phase was critical in allowing the LXP team to articulate the LXP in sufficient detail to be able to bring the vision to other Harvard stakeholders in the coming months as the idea of the LXP was socialized among key Harvard leadership and stakeholders.</p>
